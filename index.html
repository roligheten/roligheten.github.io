        <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Christian Barth Roligheten</h1>
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Software Engineer currently based out of Oslo, Norway. ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´
        </p>
        <p>
            Since graduating from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)
            in 2018 I have been working with product companies in Norway to help them realize
            their vision.
        </p>
        <p>
            I thrive working in cross-functional teams that aim to build great new products for
            their end-users. In the teams I have worked in I aim to excel at translating
            user needs, product vision and design  into viable, maintainable, and enjoyable
            user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the last 6 years I have worked on a variety of use-cases for a broad range of users. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="house-marker">Streamlining rental property management for landlords.</li>
            <li class="id-marker">Helping businesses manage and optimize their online classified ads.</li>
            <li class="calendar-marker">Assisting heavy asset industry customers plan and schedule maintenance.</li>

            <li class="tech-marker">Providing data engineers with tools to model, ingest and perform queries on industrial data with minimal coding knowledge.</li>
        </ul>
